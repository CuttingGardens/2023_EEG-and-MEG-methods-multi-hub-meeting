Here you will find the information regarding the [Cutting Gardens 2023](https://cuttinggardens2023.org) which is a distributed conference on cutting-edge methods for M/EEG data analysis. It happens simultaneously in several locations (aka. Gardens) across the world, with a common global program, broadcasted to all locations, and local programs made of talks, tutorials, posters, social events, satellitesâ€¦ as each Garden (optionally) sees fit. CuttingGardens is part of the [CuttingEEG](https://cuttingeeg.org) conference series.
