# Welcome to the EEG and MEG methods multi hub meeting 2023 

Here you will find the information regarding the [Cutting Gardens 2023](https://cuttinggardens2023.org) which is a distributed conference on cutting-edge methods for M/EEG data analysis. It happens simultaneously in several locations (aka. Gardens) across the world, with a common global program, broadcasted to all locations, and local programs made of talks, tutorials, posters, social events, satellites… as each Garden (optionally) sees fit. CuttingGardens is part of the [CuttingEEG](https://cuttingeeg.org) conference series.

## Essential information you need to know about CuttingGardens:

1. **What?** CuttingGardens is a distributed conference on cutting-edge methods for M/EEG data analysis. It happens simultaneously in several locations (aka. Gardens) across the world, with a common global program, broadcasted to all locations simultaneously, and local programs made of talks, tutorials, posters, social events, satellites… as each Garden (optionally) sees fit. CuttingGardens is part of the CuttingEEG conference series.
2. **When?** October 16th - October 19th 2023
3. **Where?** Everywhere! We have Gardens spread around the world. Get in touch and tell us where you are from so we can help you organize, and synchronize with neighboring Gardens (if any).
4. **How?** Each Garden runs independently with some support from the global organization. Gardens offer different types of activities (talks, tutorials, etc.…), each of which earns the Garden a “Badge” (badges description here). In order to know which badges you are eligible for, you can fill in this survey! And once the main features of your Garden are defined, you can sow your garden and declare it to the general organization using this form : plant your garden.
5. **How much?** It's free! We don't charge anything to join Gardens. We only ask that participants become members of the CuttingEEG association for a fee. We're happy to help with planning, but you are responsible for your own budget.

Voilà! We hope you got the idea! Below, you will find general, and more detailed information, guides and various resources to help you organize your own Garden.
