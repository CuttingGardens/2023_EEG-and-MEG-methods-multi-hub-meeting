## 3. Step 2: Style your Garden with badges

### 3.1 Organize the schedule

The CuttingGardens conference offers to broadcast “plenary talks” simultaneously online around the globe. Part of the CuttingGardens experience entails a feeling of global community to which these relatively brief moments of worldwide connection and communication are expected to contribute a lot. All local Gardens are therefore asked to participate in these online plenary talks in synch.
Each garden is then free to build its local schedule with (lots of) special events, but to maximize the feeling of taking part in the same event worldwide, we ask that these local events do not overlap with the plenary talks.
Broadcasting plenary talks earns a Garden the "Attendee" badge.

Hello all,
CuttingEEG (https://cuttingeeg.org/) is an annual international scientific meeting about cutting-edge methods for EEG/MEG research on neurophysiology.
For the first time, the 2023 edition, named CuttingGarden (https://cuttinggardens2023.org/) will be distributed : events will happen simultaneously in several locations (aka. Gardens) across the world, with a common global program, broadcasted to all locations, and local programs made of talks, tutorials, posters, social events, satellites.. as each Garden (optionally) sees fit.
The Lyon Neuroscience Research Center is organizing a Garden and invites you to participate.
Save the date! The event will take place from October 16th to 19th, 2023 in Lyon.
To stay informed and/or contribute to the organization of this event, please contact lyon.garden.2023@gmail.com.

### 3.2 Preparing tutorials  [Tutorials Gardens Only] 

The Organizing Committee provides a list of tutorials on several topics (e.g., M/EEG, statistics, GitHub, ...). Each tutorial Garden can host one or more tutorials.
There are several types of tutorials:  
Full-blown hands-on sessions (appropriate for toolboxes with high visibility in the community) meant to 1) offer a practice session to participants and 2) offer a specific training for local teaching assistants (TAs) with the aim of enabling them to offer such tutorials independently in the future. The TAs are only required to have some practice with the subject of the tutorial (e.g., how to install the software, starting up, and doing basic data analysis). Before the event, TAs will be trained by the main teacher (i.e., toolbox developer) about the specific content of the tutorial. During the event, the main teacher will broadcast the tutorial live for everyone, and TAs will provide local support in each Garden. Hand-on sessions will probably require a dedicated space for the participants to plug and use their own laptop, in addition to a broadcast system and some IT support for the participants. One Tutorial Garden will physically host the main teacher (at the teacher's discretion). 
Demo tutorials are shorter sessions with a live demo from the main teacher. Demo tutorials will only require an internet connection, screen and sound system. 

In both cases you will need a space equipped with the infrastructure to screen and host the tutorial(s).

### 3.2 Preparing poster session  [Posters Gardens Only] 

A poster session needs a dedicated space where people can present and discuss. Depending on its size, you will decide the number of posters allowed. Remember to book this space for the whole duration of the
